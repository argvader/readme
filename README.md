I grew up in Ripon, Wisconsin where we have a small liberal arts college claiming Harrison Ford as student ( *he didn't graduate *).

I was into nerdy things at a young age - loved Star Wars, saved my Basic programs on cassette tapes, was in gifted and talented in high school for math and art, was also into sports - playing football, wrestling, and ran track.

Graduated high school ( *Go Tigers!* ) and went to college at Texas A&M University where i majored in Computer Engineering. Truth be told I probably majored in basketball cause I played a ton of it during college.\
After college I worked for various companies some very large and some very small before finding my place at Asurion. ( [My LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paigegary/ "https://www.linkedin.com/in/paigegary/") )\
​​​​​​​I am married and have a teenage daughter who has started college in Graphic Design and Animation at MTSU.\
Why argvader? That is my gamer tag and the name I used during my hacker days. I wasnt like Kevin Mitnick or anything but was a little mischievous. Now I use it for github, games, slack etc.

### What is my role?

I am a Director of Engineering but what does that mean? I foster great product engineering teams. I am part of the recruiting process to help find talented diverse folks. I have a technical background so I can bounce engineering ideas. I care deeply about the members on a team and how they work. I help team members grow in their chosen career. I am an advocate for the team and its individuals.

### What are my values?

Kaizen - "continual improvement". I firmly believe in always trying to improve both as an individual and a team.

Direct Feedback - Non-anonymous constructive feedback is not easy but its such a valuable process. Being able to articulate feedback to another is a valuable skill. Without feedback improvement is difficult. Therefore, I value product retrospectives. I value 360 personal feedback. I value surveys. I value 1:1's.

Trust - I trust others and am amazed by the talented folks around. I trust everyone is trying to do their best work. I trust in the decisions of team members closer to the problem than myself.

Gestalt - A well functioning team is greater than the sum of its parts. I believe a well functioning team has a culture of 'healthy debate'.  A team willing to debate means:  The team members are comfortable enough to discuss opinions. They are engaged. They are passionate about the team's mission. A debate cant turn into a filibuster. There still must be a strong motivation for action.

ADDI - Audacity Driven / Data Informed. Totally my acronym. But I do fear constant refining of a product will find a local maximum. I believe there are times to be bold. Another term i heard is a moonshot. I believe data should inform our decisions but there are times to be audacious. Take a risk in an experiment where there may not be data then let the data tell us if we are right. Some experiments will not succeed and this is ok.

Individuals - I value the skills, the ideas, the struggles, the culture,  the incredible complex tapestry of thought each individual brings.
